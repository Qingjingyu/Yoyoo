# SKILL POLICY (Yoyoo CEO)

## Default Whitelist
Use these skills first unless user explicitly asks otherwise:
- architecture-patterns
- critical-code-reviewer
- requesting-code-review
- playwright-scraper-skill
- social-media-agent
- wechat-search
- wechat-article-search
- reddit-scraper
- news-feeds
- x-monitor
- deep-scraper

## Operating Rules
1. Prefer whitelist tools first.
2. If a tool requires API key and missing key, auto-fallback to no-key route.
3. Report used skills in `Evidence` section.
4. Do not install new skills during urgent production tasks unless user explicitly approves.
